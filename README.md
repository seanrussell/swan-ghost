# Swan

Minimal and responsive with a focus on simplicity, *Swan* is a theme that attempts to bring the focus to your content while creating a smooth experience.

Supports blog and user images; cover images, while supported in the Ghost admin, are not displayed in the theme due to theme's minimal nature.

Fonts embedded including Bodoni and Futura true type fonts.

Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ icons are trademarks of their respective owners and are from the Casper theme, copyright (c) 2013 Ghost Foundation and released under The MIT License.

Other icons provided by [Ionic](https://github.com/driftyco/ionicons) and released under MIT license.

See *Swan* in action at [Swan Demo](http://swan-theme.seandrussell.com/). Note that because heroku periodically removes images, the only image displayed in the demo is a demo logo that is within the assets folder. Ordinarily, this would be the blog logo as uploaded through the admin interfact.
